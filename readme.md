# Advance Cyber Security
## Binod Ghimire

The Advance Cyber Security project demonstrates the implementation of advanced cybersecurity features in a web application. The purpose of this project is to showcase the importance of implementing robust security measures to protect user data and prevent cyber attacks.

## Tool used
The project is built using various technologies including HTML5, CSS3, Django, SQLite3, and VSCode. These tools provide a solid foundation for building a secure and reliable web application.

## Pages Included
The project includes several pages that are essential for a web application, including a Register page, Login page, Home page, and Registration success page. These pages are designed to provide a smooth and seamless user experience while ensuring maximum security.

## Features
The project includes several advanced features that help to ensure the security of user data and prevent cyber attacks. Some of the key features include:
- Google reCaptcha
This feature provides an additional layer of security by requiring users to complete a reCaptcha challenge before accessing home page.
- Password Encryption
The project uses a custom encryption module using SH-256 Algorithm to encrypt passwords before storing them in the database. This helps to prevent attackers from accessing sensitive information such as passwords.
- Preventation from sql injection
The project uses parameterized queries and data sanitization to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- Password Protection
The project includes several features to protect passwords, including password strength checker, password validation, password expiration check, and password change.

Overall, the project showcases the importance of implementing advanced cybersecurity features to protect user data and prevent cyber attacks. The use of robust security measures such as encryption, data sanitization, and password protection can significantly reduce the risk of cyber attacks and ensure the security of user data.
